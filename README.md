NAME
====

SSH::LibSSH::Tunnel - establish remote forwarding SSH tunnel

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use SSH::LibSSH::Tunnel;

my SSH::LibSSH::Tunnel:D $ssh-tunnel .= new: :tunnel-host<intermediary>,
   :tunnel-user<useratintermediary>,
   :tunnel-port(22), # default is 22 (ssh)
   :local-host<127.0.0.1>, # default is 127.0.0.1 (localhost)
   :local-port<33333>, # default (zero) means "let the OS choose"
   :remote-host<finaldestination>,
   :remote-port<3306>,
   :private-key-file($*HOME.add: '.ssh/some_key'),
   :timeout(30); # default is 30s -- passed to SSH::LibSSH
my $connection = $ssh-tunnel.connect;
# at this point, the tunnel is already connected
my $port-to-connect = $ssh-tunnel.local-port; # useful if passed the default
```

intermediary host (will connect on it via ssh)

### has Int(Any) $.tunnel-port

intermediary SSH service port

### has Str $.tunnel-user

SSH user on the intermediary host

### has IO(Any) $.private-key-file

SSH private key file for connection (no password, for now)

### has Str $.remote-host

destination tunnel host

### has Int(Any) $.remote-port

destination tunnel port

### has Int(Any) $.timeout
